# Privacy essay

### Introduction
In the last couple of decades society has been transformed by technology, but there is a growing sentiment that the technology we love is working against our values in ways that are not clear. Privacy is one such area where we ought to be concerned, because while technology is changing the way we live, it does so by integrating heavily with our minds. What before was the quiet comfort of our thoughts can now be examined and used by commercial and governmental actors in the name targeted advertisements, preventing terror attacks, politics, and much more. 
Modern technology has many aspects so we should resist taking a hard stance, but in this essay I look at ways in which technology works against privacy values that we seem to hold in Western society. I will tackle the most common objection to privacy concern, namely the "Nothing to hide" argument, and argue for a more nuanced view of privacy. 

### What is privacy?
Defining privacy has long been a challenge for scholars. It is difficult because we use it in inconsistent ways, and it has come to mean different things to different persons. As Judith Jarvis Thomson observes [^1]. 
> Perhaps the most striking thing about privacy, is that nobody seems to have any very clear idea what it is.
But our inability to define privacy has not meant that we stop using the term. In legal and political debates, privacy is often invoked as a core value, but in the absent of a definition we struggle to compare it against conflicting interests. This has caused privacy to lose out in many situation, because courts and legislators might not be able to recognize when and how privacy is implicated. 

There have been several attempts at conceptualizing privacy. One could for instance define it in terms of the private-public spheres. Information that is readily available to the public like race cannot be considered private information, as that is information we cannot keep out of sight. The sharp distinction between private and public gives maybe the clearest definition of privacy, but it has some large problems that we will discuss later. 



A related and common approach is to define privacy in terms of intimacy. This was well put by philosopher Julie Innes [^2].
> The content of privacy cannot be captured if we focus exclusively on either information, access, or intimate decisions because privacy involves all three areas. ... I suggest that these apparently disparate areas are linked by the common denominator of intimacy—privacy’s content covers _intimate_  information, access, or decisions.  
> This is also a narrow and bounded conception of privacy, but it comes at the cost of either being too narrow or broadening the definition of intimacy to mean privacy, which isn't a good solution. Many persons would not regard their email or bank account number as intimate, but they sure are private. 

There are two big challenges in defining privacy. (1) The definition must capture the features of privacy in a wide set of contexts, and (2) the definition must be able to cope with the rapid advances in information technology. Following Daniel Solove's lead, we will resist the temptation of defining the core of privacy. Instead we will view privacy more as a family resemblance problem. 
Solove creates a taxonomy of four main categories with in total sixteen subcategories where he argues that privacy concerns are relevant  [ @solove2007ve, p 758]. 

- **Information collection**: Surveillance, Interrogation
- **Information processing**: Aggregation, Identification, Insecurity, Secondary use, Exclusion
- **Information dissemination**: Breach of confidentiality, Disclosure, Exposure, Increased Accessibility, Blackmail, Appropriation, Distortion
- **Invasion**: Intrusion, Decisional Interference

Viewing privacy in this manner, Solove argues, will allow us to focus on the problems instead of getting hung up on the terms. Another way of focusing on the problems is shown to us by the European Unions (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR defines the notion of _personal data_, as [\@gdprPersonalData]

> Personal data is any information that relates to identified or identifiable living individual. 

When multiple pieces of pseudonymized data can be combined to identify a person, then it also counts as personal data. With GDPR, there is this idea that persons own their personal data, and personal data is any information about a person that has not been anonymized. Solove's taxonomy of privacy goes well with the notion of personal data, because the taxonomy lays out areas where personal data might be used. 

For the remainder of this essay we will use this pluralistic notion of privacy and attempt to reframe questions of privacy in terms of personal data, as this might help us value privacy against other important values. 

### The value of privacy

Given the amorphous nature of privacy it can be hard to articulate ways in which it is important. Great works of fiction, like Orwell's _1984_ and Kafka's _The Trial_ , have shown us how societies completely lacking in privacy considerations can turn out. While these books are great for illustrating certain arguments, we should be able to defend privacy solely based on reality. 

In an article for [teachprivacy.com][1], Daniel Solove gives a list of 10 reasons why privacy matters. One of the reasons he gives is that privacy puts firm limits on the power of organizations over individuals. By giving every person control over their own data and where it may or may not be used, privacy empowers everyone against encroachment of large organizations. Privacy is key to maintaining a successful democracy, because citizens need to be able to communicate or organize without government involvement. Privacy is also essential for individual expression, for instance a 


 
The value of reducing privacy is mostly in the hands of those who can exploit it.
